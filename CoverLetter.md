Test Employer

Hello,

I am a Java programmer with a year and a half of experience in SDET operations and QA automation. I possess a Bachelor's and Associate's in Computer Science. I find great pleasure in the Software Development life cycle and wish to continue my career in this field.
 After browseing Indeed.com for opportunities in a position I can provide my expertise in, I ran across your opening for a Software Tester.


As a QA/Automation developer, at globalLogic, it was my duty to ensure the product provided to the costumer functioned according to the user stories every sprint. I was assigned to write automated test cases using tools like selenium, postman, and Jmeter.
 I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications.


I possess all of the skills you have listed, OOP, .NET framework, software testing, and system development methodologies; however, I believe, I am a cut above the rest when it comes to reading and applying technical documentation. At GlobalLogic, I was assigned to writing automated tests for the validation of downloaded .csv files from selenium box. The problem was that selenium box, the service used by the team, was how we interfaced with our web application. By steping through the documentation, and writing prototype code, I was able to create a working soulution for the team to use when validating the contents of the downloaded files. If you have any legacy code paired with any semblance of documentation I can and will be able to pick it up with speed and effectiveness.


I am well practiced, well expirenced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you the highest excelence and quality assurance for you and the costomer. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.


Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
