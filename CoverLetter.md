Dear David,

My name is Cole Kendall. I am a Java programmer with a year and a half of experience in SDET operations and QA automation. I possess a Bachelor's and Associate's in Computer Science. I find great pleasure in the Software Development life cycle and wish to continue my career in this field.
 After browseing Indeed.com for opportunities in a position I can provide my expertise in, I ran across your opening for a Software Tester.


As a QA/Automation developer, at globalLogic, it was my duty to ensure the product provided to the costumer functioned according to the user stories every sprint. I was assigned to write automated test cases using tools like selenium, postman, and Jmeter.
 I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications.


I take incredible pride in my capacities in the field of software development in general. If called to the task, I could perform all standard task relevant to testing your software to make sure it meets the costumer's specifications. Outside of work activities, I take great pleasure in finding software oriented solutions to everyday problems. I have used AWS to host game servers for my friends. I could deploy selenium box for you on a EC instance. I have written path finding algorithms to allow my friends artwork spring to life and move like it has a mind of it's own. I could write a script that checks for the existence of a file hidden deep in a code base for you. I helped a friend's side hustle of flipping mislisted items online by writing a web scraper to check prices daily and them alert them when a item is at a critical discount. I could write an application that checks the availability of different endpoints and alerts you of their downtime.


I am well practiced, well expirenced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you the highest excelence and quality assurance for you and the costomer. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.


Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
