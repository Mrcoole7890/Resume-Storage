Collins Aerospace

Hello,

I am a Java programmer with a year and a half of experience in SDET operations and QA automation. I possess a Bachelor's and Associate's in Computer Science. I find great pleasure in the Software Development life cycle and wish to continue my career in this field. I was referred by Steve Kontzias to apply for this position and after reading the requirements I believe that I would be a decent fit for the position of Systems Integration and Test Engineer at Collins Aerospace.

As a QA/Automation developer, at globalLogic, it was my duty to ensure the product provided to the customer functioned according to the user stories every sprint. The product I performed testing on was built using a microservices architecture. I was assigned to write automated test cases using tools like selenium, postman, and Jmeter. Everyday I would meet with the onshore team to discuss the progress of each user story my team was assigned. In some sprints I was assigned to perform manual sanity testing. About 90% of our test cases involved interactions with the API calls (using Postman or Jmeter) subsequently validating its expected effect on a dashboard. I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications.

I am well practiced, well experienced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you with the highest excellence and quality assurance for you and the customer. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
