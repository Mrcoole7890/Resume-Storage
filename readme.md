# Resume Storage

## Objective

Given that my Resume should be an ever growing and ever adapting document, I feel that having it stored on a remote repository would benefit me. Additionally, I would like to store it using markdown rather than office or google docs file formats.

## Notes

I use pandoc to convert my resume.md file to PDF the last time I used a command for it was:

`pandoc -s -V geometry:margin=.5in -o Resume.pdf Resume.md`

I use pandoc to convert my CoverLetter.md to PDF by using:

`pandoc -o CoverLetter.pdf CoverLetter.md`
