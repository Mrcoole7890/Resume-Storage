I take incredible pride in my capacities in the field of software development in general. If called to the task, I could perform all standard task relevant to testing your software to make sure it meets the costumer's specifications. Outside of work activities, I take great pleasure in finding software oriented solutions to everyday problems. I have used AWS to host game servers for my friends. I could deploy selenium box for you on a EC instance. I have written path finding algorithms to allow my friends artwork spring to life and move like it has a mind of it's own. I could write a script that checks for the existence of a file hidden deep in a code base for you. I helped a friend's side hustle of flipping mislisted items online by writing a web scraper to check prices daily and them alert them when a item is at a critical discount. I could write an application that checks the availability of different endpoints and alerts you of their downtime.
