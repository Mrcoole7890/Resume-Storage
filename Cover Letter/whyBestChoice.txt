I am hungry for a challenge. I will be the man you call to have as 110% present to solve your problems with passions and completeness. I am familiar with most of the technologies described in your job posting. I have written personal applications with MySQL and could transition my expirence to understand Oracle SQL and MongoDB. My previouse job used Spring Boot to manage all of the micro services. I am currently writing this cover letter using Linux Mint running in a VM. I could invest my onbaording time to understand WebLogic.
