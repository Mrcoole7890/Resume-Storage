I possess all of the skills you have listed, OOP, .NET framework, software testing, and system development methodologies; however, I believe, I am a cut above the rest when it comes to reading and applying technical documentation. At GlobalLogic, I was assigned to writing automated tests for the validation of downloaded .csv files from selenium box. The problem was that selenium box, the service used by the team, was how we interfaced with our web application. By steping through the documentation, and writing prototype code, I was able to create a working soulution for the team to use when validating the contents of the downloaded files. If you have any legacy code paired with any semblance of documentation I can and will be able to pick it up with speed and effectiveness.
