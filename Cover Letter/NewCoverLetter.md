Collins Aerospace

Hello,

My name is Cole Kendall. I am a Java programmer with a year and a half of experience in SDET operations and QA automation. I possess a Bachelor's and Associate's in Computer Science. I find great pleasure in the Software Development life cycle and wish to continue my career in this field. I was referred by Steve Kontzias to apply for this position and affer reading the requirements I belive that I would be a decent fit to the position at Collins Aerospace.

As a QA/Automation developer, at globalLogic, it was my duty to ensure the product provided to the costumer functioned according to the user stories every sprint. I was assigned to write automated test cases using tools like selenium, postman, and Jmeter. Everyday I would meet with the onshore team to discuss the progress of each user story my team was assigned. In some sprints I was assgined to perform manual sanity testing. About 90% of our testcases involved interactions with the API calls (using Postman or Jmeter) subsequently validating its expected effect on a dashboard. I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications.

I am well practiced, well expirenced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you the highest excelence and quality assurance for you and the costomer. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
