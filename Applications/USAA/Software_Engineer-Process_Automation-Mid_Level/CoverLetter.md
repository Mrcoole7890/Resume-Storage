USAA

Hello,

I am a Developer with working experience as a SDET with a focus in automation testing. I was a Java automation developer while working under GlobalLogic. Before this, I was an avid computer programming hobbyist/student since 2016. Given that USAA is who I do business with for banking and insurance, I decided to look for an opening on your careers page. I was pleasantly surprised to find an opening that was conducting operations closely related to the last project I was hired on for.

I served as a SDET and performed a mix of automated and manual testing on a conversation dashboard while also assisting in the validation of our alerting system when given a sequence of API calls to various distributed technologies. I wrote automation tests in Java and utilized bash scripting to make cURL requests to various APIs across the system. I interacted with the MySQL database to modify tables on the QA environments to influence how requests would be processed later down the pipeline. I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications. I studied and passed these as a means to display my broad capacities in the field of computer science. While working under USAA I wish to continue increasing my value to you, as my prospective employer in this way.

I take pride in my work as a craftsman would. I have a genuine passion for the Software Development Life Cycle. When you give me a task to complete, you can be assured that I will execute it with completeness, excellence, and in a timely manner. At the end of the day, I want to provide my skills to something greater than myself. I believe working under USAA as part of a team in Contact Center Technology, would not only benefit me to gain more experience as a Software Developer, but would also benefit you as you see my skills appreciate in value, as I absorb and apply everything I experience in service under you.


I am well practiced, well experienced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you with the highest excellence and quality assurance for you. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
