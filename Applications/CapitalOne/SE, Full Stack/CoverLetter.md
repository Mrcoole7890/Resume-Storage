CapitalOne

Hello,

I am a Developer with working experience as a SDET with a focus in automation testing. I was a Java automation developer while working under GlobalLogic. Before this, I was an avid computer programming hobbyist/student since 2016. I found your opening listed on Indeed and applied to this position believing that I could provide my skills and expertise to your team.

During the time training under Revature, I developed full stack applications to write test automation suites against. We used MySQL, Spring Boot, and Angular. At the end of our training cycle me and about 15 other training batchmates worked on a social media app using this stack. I possess both the Security+ and the AWS CCP certifications and intend to continue obtaining certifications. I studied and passed these as a means to display my broad capacities in the field of computer science. While working under CapitalOne I wish to continue increasing my value to you, as my prospective employer in this way.

I take pride in my work as a craftsman would. I have a genuine passion for the Software Development Life Cycle. When you give me a task to complete, you can be assured that I will execute it with completeness, excellence, and in a timely manner. At the end of the day, I want to provide my skills to something greater than myself. I believe working under CapitalOne, would not only benefit me to gain more experience as a Software Developer, but would also benefit you as you see my skills appreciate in value, as I absorb and apply everything I experience in service under you.

I am well practiced, well experienced, and well adjusted to join your team. I wish nothing more than to provide you with the highest excellence and quality assurance for you. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
