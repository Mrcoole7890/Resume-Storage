Computer Concepts

Hello Mr. Craig,

I came in earlier to ask for an opportunity as a part-time employee at your store. You told me that you didn't immediately need anyone at the moment; however, you still gave me the respect to provide me your business card and desire to add my resume to your files. As a sign of my appreciation, I will proceed with the respect to provide you with a cover letter alongside my resume to reciprocate your professionality. On the computer concepts website, your store's page describes that while you were in William and Mary you would repair game consoles for your peers all while pursuing a degree in Political Science. With only this information I believe that you enjoy your work at Computer Concepts. In this way I believe you and I are similar in the way of doing what we enjoy.

Before Albert Einstein published his papers on his theory of general relativity, he worked a humble position as an assistant in a swiss patent office. I am a Computer Scientist with experience in Software Development. I have a year of professional experience writing test automation programs. I used Java specifically to write dozens of test cases to be committed to a test suite utilized by my team to supplement our QA operations. I find great personal pleasure in all things computing. I have repaired and built many machines, programmed many applications, hosted many servers, and wish to continue sharpening my skill in this ever growing field. Aside from software development and computer repair, I like going on long walks around williamsburg and from time to time I will pick up trash along longhill road when I don't feel like playing video games. I like growing grapes and I am trying to learn guitar.

When an opening appears at your store, please contact me. I would find a decent bit of personal happiness working at computer concepts if given the opportunity.

Thank you,

Cole Kendall
