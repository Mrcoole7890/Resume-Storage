Westinghouse

Greetings,

I am applying to work under Westinghouse as a Natural Gas Analyst. I possess a Bachelor’s and Associate’s in Computer Science. I have prior experience performing quality assurance with systems utilizing micro services. I found this job listing by being signed up to the email list under Westinghouse. I believe that work in the field of power production and distribution will provide me with meaningfulness and fulfillment. This is why I choose to continue looking for opportunities provided under the Westinghouse brand.

While working at GlobalLogic, I wrote tests against many different services. I crafted curl requests to validate event logs on splunk. I contributed to the team’s automated test suite, that ran automated tests against their web application. I was responsible for assisting leadership with executing and interpreting stress tests against different services within the system being developed. I am a Computer Scientist. Planning, developing, testing, and executing processes to repeatedly and reliably complete a goal is second nature to me. I am always looking to refine my workflow. While working on your team, you will see that I move with a purpose and work to meet tasks with diligence.

I am hungry for a challenge. I will be the man you call to have 110% present to solve your problems with passions and completeness. I wish nothing more than to provide you with the highest excellence and quality of work for you. I hope
to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
