City Of Hampton


Hello,


I am a Computer Scientist with extensive experience. I am proficient with Java, C++, JS, C#, and Python. I have a year of professional experience writing test automation development. I used Java specifically to write dozens of test cases to be committed to a test suite utilized by my team to supplement our QA operations. I am always learning new things and by product, I am the man that disseminated information to my teammates after, to be incorporated into our operational workflow.


You will see my impact on your team instantly. I am quick to identify my role in a team's workflow and strive to complete my assigned tasks with diligence.  I know that I will provide added knowledge to your team. I am able to see the forest among the trees. I have been blessed to have working experience before this opportunity provided by Hampton and I would like to provide to you my expertise.


I have spent almost a decade in the peninsula area and I would like to give back to the people I have grown to appreciate being around. I greatly enjoy anything computing or involving systems maintenance. Please consider me for this application so that I may be able to carry out my desires to help the community I have grown up with.


Sincerely,


Cole Kendall
