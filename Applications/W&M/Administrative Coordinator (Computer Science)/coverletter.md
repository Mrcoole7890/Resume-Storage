Hello, \newline

I am applying to work under your institution as an Administrative Coordinator. In reference to the nature of the responsibilities posted in the listing, I am an incredibly passionate Computer Scientist. It is my life long goal to learn everything within the ever broadening field of computing. I have lived in Williamsburg for three years and have had a deep interest in meeting and learning from people in a similar background as me. \newline

At my previous employment, with GlobalLogic, I was an SDET, responsible for both writing automation tests and executing manual testing operations. During my time there I developed a greater scope on how systems break or bend under the pressure of ever changing environments. Environments not too dissimilar from the world of academia. \newline

The project that I was assigned under at GlobalLogic ended in the summer of 2023. I was turned back over to Revature, the folks who hired me out to GL. During this time I had saved enough money to go back to finish my last semester at CNU. I requested for a mutual release from Revature and, on the same day. I enrolled in my last classes needed to graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. \newline

I am excited about the opportunity to work with people who have a similar passion in computer science as I do. I hope to meet the folks in the department soon so that I can spend my working hours in a field I can see myself proud and passionate about with others who are like minded! \newline
