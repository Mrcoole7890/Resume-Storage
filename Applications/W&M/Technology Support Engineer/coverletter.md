William & Mary


Greetings,


I am applying to work at the College of William and Mary as a Technology Support Engineer. I possess a Bachelor’s and Associate’s in Computer Science. The process of maintaining and troubleshooting computing systems has always interested me. As a Computer Scientist, I am always looking to expand my field of expertise and breadth of knowledge. During my time with GlobalLogic, I used MacOS for development, I program as a hobbyist using a variety of linux configurations, and I use windows for all other purposes.


While working at GlobalLogic, I wrote tests against many different services. I crafted curl requests to validate event logs on splunk. I contributed to the team’s automated test suite, which ran automated tests against their web application. Planning, developing, testing, and executing processes to repeatedly and reliably complete a goal is second nature to me. I am always looking to refine my workflow. While working on your team, you will see that I move with a purpose and work to meet tasks with diligence.


I am hungry for a challenge. I will be the man you call to have 110% present to solve your problems with passions and completeness. I wish nothing more than to provide you with the highest excellence and quality of work for you. I hope to hear from you to discuss how we may move forward.


Sincerely,


Cole Kendall
