Newport News Shipbuilding

Hello,

You are reading the cover letter of a direct, driven, and determined individual. With me, you will receive an individual who appreciates the people side of technology just as much as he works to refine his skills in all things information technology. During my time at GlobalLogic, I was occasionally assigned to test new software features against an array of MySQL tables. I am aware of the many ways database technologies are used to supplement the essential workflows of any organization.

You will see my impact on your team instantly. I am quick to identify my role in a team's workflow and strive to complete my assigned tasks with diligence. There are some individuals who may apply to this position, unsure of themselves and timid to believe that they will provide value. You will not see this from me. I know that I will provide added knowledge to your team. I am able to see the forest among the trees. I have been blessed to have working experience before this opportunity provided by the Newport News Shipyard.

You may believe, after reading the above sections, that I possess some level of arrogance or ego that would be detrimental as a team member. I would like to make sure you do not feel this way by giving due respects to your organization. The shipyard is responsible for building ships that carry nuclear weapons capable of leveling cities. I am 25 years old and I refuse to believe that there are not any men or women who have working experience that is twice my age. The thought of getting a possibility to work and learn under the giants before me excites me. I want the opportunity to work with the great minds who design these ships. Please consider me for the position of Database Administrator at the Newport News Shipyard.

Sincerely,

Cole Kendall
