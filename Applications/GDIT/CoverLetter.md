GDIT


Hello,


I am a SDET with extensive experience. I am proficient with Java, C++, JS, C#, and Python. I have a year of professional experience writing test automation development. I used Java specifically to write dozens of test cases to be committed to a test suite utilized by my team to supplement our QA operations. I am always learning new things and by product, I am the man that disseminated information to my teammates after, to be incorporated into our operational workflow.


You will see my impact on your team instantly. I am quick to identify my role in a team's workflow and strive to complete my assigned tasks with diligence. There are some individuals who may apply to this position, unsure of themselves and timid to believe that they will provide value. You will not see me timid or unsure. I know that I will provide added knowledge to your team. I am able to see the forest among the trees. I have been blessed to have working experience before this opportunity provided by GDIT.


After reading the above, you may think that I possess a level of arrogance or ego that may come off as unbecoming for a team environment; however, I would like to do my due diligence and put those worries to rest. I will never know everything yet I still wish to spend my life trying. On this earth there is something to learn from every experience and every person. I want to serve under GDIT as an employee and as a continuous learner. Please consider me for this position as a Software Developer Associate.


Sincerely,


Cole Kendall
